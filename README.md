# Spectral-Clustering-Implementation

We have to generate our own data sets using the initials of name and graduation year. For example Mukul sharma passout in 2020 have initials as MS 2020. I have created the data by clicking the image of my initials and then store that image pixel values in matrix. 

After generating the data, apply the spectral clustering algorithms and show different spectrals in the initials with different colors.
